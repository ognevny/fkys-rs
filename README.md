# FKYSoxide
this is a [F*cking Kill Yourself lang](https://github.com/eleoelo/fkys) interpretter, independently
rewritten in Rust.

## Syntax
```
> - move pointer to the right
< - move pointer to the left
+ - increment cell by one
- - decrement cell
i - integer output mode (enabled by default)
c - character output mode
n - newline
o - prints the contents of the cell to the console
p - accepts input from the user into the cell 
```
tabs, spaces and other symbols are just ignored (but commenting isn't supported now)
